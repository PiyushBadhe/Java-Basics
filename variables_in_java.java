/** ******************************
 *  | Types of Variables in Java |
 *  ******************************
 * 
 * 1. Instance Variables
 *  - Instance Variables are declared in a class but outside a method declaration
 *  - Declared without using 'static' keyword
 * 
 * 2. Static Variables
 *  - Initialised only once at the start of program execution
 *  - These variables should be initialised first before initialisation of any instance variable
 *  - Defined in a class but outside method declaration
 * 
 * 3. Local Variables
 *  - Declared inside the body of the method
